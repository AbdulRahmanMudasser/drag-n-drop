You are generating fully responsive HTML/CSS/JS for a Squarespace section (Services page). Follow these exact rules and match the provided snapshot pixel-for-pixel:

- Layout: Outer container spans full viewport width; inner content max width 1200px. No horizontal overflow. Desktop and mobile must use the full viewport width responsibly.
- Vertical spacing: Do not add extra top/bottom padding beyond what is visible. Keep vertical rhythm tight. The rendered section must end where the content ends—no trailing empty space.
- Images: Use https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS2zB0nerySNz6gJR3RE1aYmULKfjarVYBKIA&s. Preserve aspect ratio; do not stretch.
- Typography: Use “Helvetica Neue” throughout. Main headings ~40px bold (desktop). Subheadings 14–18px normal weight. Names/roles slightly bolder. Body text ~12–13px.
- Subheading exact styles: margin: 0 auto 32px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #2c2c2c; max-width: 640px; font-weight: 400.
- Classes: Use descriptive, lengthy, section-unique class names to avoid conflicts (for Pricing page).
- Icons: Only use external icon sets (e.g., Google Material Icons); do not draw custom icons.
- Responsiveness: Desktop and mobile must match the snapshot exactly, full-bleed width with capped inner content. No unintended vertical whitespace at top or bottom.
- Output: Provide complete HTML/CSS/JS for the section only. Do not include comments.
