I am working on a Squarespace website. I’ll share snapshots or code, and you will write fully responsive HTML/CSS/JS that exactly matches the snapshot, takes the full viewport width on desktop and mobile, and uses no comments.

The site’s working width is 1200px: content should be capped at 1200px while the outer container spans the full viewport width.

Use descriptive, lengthy, section-unique variable/class names so they don’t conflict with other page elements (this section is for the about us page).

For images, use this URL: "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS2zB0nerySNz6gJR3RE1aYmULKfjarVYBKIA&s" and do not stretch the image (match the snapshot).

Use the font "Helvetica Neue" (import if needed) consistently across the section.

Use icons sourced from Google (Material Icons) or other external icon sets; do not draw or create custom icons yourself.
